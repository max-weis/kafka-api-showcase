# Kafka Resource Adapter (by Payara)

Payara provides a [resource adapter](https://github.com/payara/Cloud-Connectors/tree/master/Kafka) for Apache Kafka which enables using Message Driven Beans to consume Kafka records in a Java Enterprise application.

The sample contains two modules using the Payara Kafka resource adapter to communicate with the Kafka broker  
* `kafka-ra-producer` containing a Kafka producer
* `kafka-ra-consumer` containing a Kafka consumer

## Kafka Resource Adapter

_HINT: Due to some configuration issues, the resource adapter is not working with Open Liberty at the moment. The sample runs on Wildfly Application Server instead._
